continue button field: vessa_intro_a
question: |
  Legal protections for time off
subquestion: |
  The Victimsâ€™ Economic Security and Safety Act (VESSA) became a law in Illinois in August, 2003. VESSA describes what employers must do to help survivors of **{domestic violence}**, **{sexual violence}**, **{stalking}**, **{gender-based violence}**, or any other crime of violence keep their jobs and stay safe.

  You are protected by VESSA if you are a survivor of domestic violence or sexual violence, or if you are helping a family or household member who is a survivor. VESSA also allows you to take time off work if your family or household member was killed by a crime of violence.
  
  ${ collapse_template(vessa_intro_b) }  
terms:
  sexual violence: |
    Sexual violence can be sexual assault, non-consensual sexual acts, or sex with a minor.
  domestic violence: |
    Domestic violence can be physical abuse, harassment, or intimidation of family or other household members.
  stalking: |
    Stalking is when someone acts in a way they know, or should know, would make a normal person scared for their safety or feel emotional distress.
  gender-based violence: |
    Gender-based violence is violence targetting someone because of their sex or gender.
---
template: vessa_intro_b
subject: |
  **How much time off can I get?**
content: |
  The amount of unpaid time off you get under VESSA depends on the number of employees at your job, whether your employer is a government agency, and why you are taking time off.
  
  
  This program will ask you questions about your employer to determine how much time off you can get.
